# Welcome to Victor's Code Notes

This is a small collection of code notes that I'm gathering after finally ditching OneNote.

Feel free to clone them [here](https://github.com/victor-ferrer/code_notes)

### How to generate new content

This repository uses [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for generating an HTML website from the markdown files.

 - Write new pages and link them in `mkdocks.yml`
 - Execute `mkdocs build` and commit the binaries produced to the master branch
 - Set up a `github-pages` environment that watches for changes and deploys the new content.
